This folder contains the implementations of two metrics for sets of trajectories to measure the accuracy of multi-target tracking algorithms.

- examplesForTrajectoryMetric.m runs a demo with the trajectory metric in [1] based on linear programming.
- LPTrajMetric_cluster.m contains the implementation of [1], based on linear programming and clustering.
- examplesForTWTrajectoryMetric runs a demo with the time-weighted trajectory metric in [2], also based on linear programming.
- TimeWeightedLPTrajMetric_cluster.m contains the implementation of [2], based on linear programming and clustering.
