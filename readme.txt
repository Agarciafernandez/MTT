This repository contains the Matlab implementations of the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter described in

IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 54, no. 4, pp. 1883–1901, Aug. 2018.


The filter isevaluated using the generalised optimal subpattern-assignment (GOSPA)
