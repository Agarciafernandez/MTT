- Evaluation of the multi-target filters is based on the generalised optimal subpattern-assignment (GOSPA) and its decomposition into localisation errors for properly detected targets, and costs for false and missed targets.

- Evaluation of multi-target trackers is based on the LP trajectory metric for sets of trajectories and its decomposition into localisation errors for properly detected targets, and costs for false, missed targets, and track switches.
