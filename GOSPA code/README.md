# GOSPA

## Synopsis

This repository includes a MATLAB implementation of the generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment metric (GOSPA) to measure the distance between two finite sets of real vectors. Note that the two sets can have different cardinality. For details about GOSPA, check <https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05585>. Also visit <https://youtu.be/M79GTTytvCM> for a 15-min presentation about the metric.

## Usage
The provided implementation of GOSPA (in GOSPA.m) is based on the auction algorithm, the code (in auctionAlgortihm.m) for which is also available in the repository. An example 'exampleScript.m' is added to illustrate the usage of the GOSPA implementation.
